## FEED READER TESTING

This project is one the projects (#5) in Udacity Front End Nanodegree program. It is required to be 
completed by meeting requirements given in related rubric. A feed reader project has been given mainly
with ./index.html, ./css/style.css,./js/app.js, Jasmine library and an incomplete feedreader.js spec file.
Jasmine is a framework for testing javascript code. For more information please see [Jasmine](https://jasmine.github.io/pages/docs_home.html) site.
The project is targeted to complete the testing process by completing feedreader.js javascript code. So in 
feedreader.js file, the test expectation for both sych and asych tests can be found.

### Getting Started

Program consists of html, css and javascript files together with jasmine library and specs.


### Prerequisites

The program runs on the browsers such as Google Chrome, Safari with latest updates.  

### Installing

The program can be cloned or downloaded from the link [feed-reader-test](https://github.com/hasanOzyavru/feed-reader-test)
by using the following command in Terminal for MacOS or in Git Bash for Windows systems. 

```git clone https://github.com/hasanOzyavru/feed-reader-test.git```  

A folder is created in the root where you write `git clone` command. In this folder you may see the html file
and css,js folders.

### Files

1. index.html
2. js/app.js
3. css/app.css
4. jasmine/spec/feedreader.js (This is the file to see how testing is prepared)
5. README.md

are the files to be focused on.

### Running the test

Running index.html file in your default browser will start the program. 

### The outcome

When the index.html is started, the program will run and do tests defined in feedreader.js to see if all expectations
are met and if the test is fully successful. The summary is given at the bottom such as "7 specs, 0 failures" together with
the specs which contain our expectations. If any one of the expectations is not met, it is going to be reported as "failure"
with spec name and description.
